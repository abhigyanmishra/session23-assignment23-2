Explain Primary data types and complex data types in Hive with an example in brief.

There are two types of data types-

1)Primary data type

Primary data type is further divided in 4 types-
•	Numeric –It has data types like
1.	TINYINT, -128 to 127 
2.	SMALLINT, -32768 to 32768
3.	INT
4.	BIGINT(Similar to int,longint in java) 
•	String type- It can be String,varchar or char
Varchar is basically variable type.It if the value is less than what specified then it silently truncates the empty spaces.eg- name VARCHAR(10).
Range is 1 to 65535
Char is for static or fixed length of characters, if the value is shorter than that specified then it is padded with spaces. The maximum length is 255 characters.
Eg- char name[10]; 
•	Date time
DATE eg- DATE ‘2016-11-07’
TIMESTAMP eg- yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss 
•	Miscellaneous type 
they include Boolean,binary data types.

2)Complex data type

•	ARRAY<data type>
Eg- ARRAY(‘abhigyan’,’mishra’)
•	MAP<primitive type,data_type>
It is the collection of key value pair.
•	Struct<col_name:data_type>
